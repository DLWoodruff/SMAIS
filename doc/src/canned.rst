Pre-built Examples
==================

We experimented with four examples with the ``smais `` distribution and more are being added all the time. 

* farmer: This is a widely used example from Birge and Louveaux [birge2011]_ extended to be scalable.

* cvar: A very simple CVaR-only model that was used for experiments in [lam2018assessing]_.

* newsvendor: A simple two-stage stochastic program example provided in [lubin2023jump]_.

* multi-knapsack: originates from the stochastic programming problem discussed in [VW08]_ and also ex- plored in [Kin12]_
